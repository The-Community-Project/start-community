# start-community
> The first community this project is aiming at



The Community Project is a project that aims to make trading in a community easy and user-friendly. With a view to the development and progress of the small self-employed person and the ease of use of the customers.

This first repo is going to be for my own town.

In the folder "website-sketch" u will find sketches for all the different pages the website needs to contain. The folder is divided in the three main categories: company, customer, courier. This way it is easy to see how the same pages differ depending on who u are logged in as.


__The goal__ is to make a website where u can log on as a customer, courier or company and interact with one another. Some basic agreements:

1. The customer can only see companies.
> Customers can make contact with these companies and thus make orders. Orders will not (yet) be done inside the website. There will be a telephone number available to the customers to make orders.

1. Couriers can also only see companies.
> All the same as with the customer. There is one difference here, couriers will have a contact form at the company page so they can apply for work.

1. Companies can see all available couriers and other companies (only to make contact).
> Companies will have 2 main pages. The first one to see all the available couriers and the second one is going to be the same as for the customer and courier. Only one difference, if a company selects another company they can not place any orders and will only see the crucial information so they can keep in contact.

## Necessities
1. Website
1. Database

I plan on hosting the website from my home since my own town is really small.
